Gemino is a free and open-source AI-powered platform designed to make the journey of learning German fun, engaging, and effective.

## What is Gemino?

Gemino is a combination of an ed-tech platform, a full-stack social-media experience, a friendly learning community full of healthy challenges, and a powerful AI-powered learning integration.

## Features

### Interactive Levels

Gemino has a library of over 50 interactive levels powered by AI. These levels will guide you through the German language-learning process and are designed to keep you engaged as you progress in your language journey. We are constantly adding more levels each week.

### AI-Powered Tutor

Meet Bob, your 24/7 AI-powered tutor. Bob is there to assist you at any time, day or night. Have questions, doubts, or need help with past mistakes? Bob is just one message away. With Bob, you'll never feel alone on your language-learning journey.

### Personalized Flashcards

Gemino takes personalization to the next level by generating exclusive flashcards tailored to your learning style and past mistakes. Use these flashcards to revise your errors and grasp new concepts with ease.

### Gemino Dictionary

No more leaving the platform to look up unfamiliar terms! Gemino integrates a dictionary directly into its interface, accessible anytime, anywhere across the platform. You can even search for commonly used phrases in German and get their meanings right away!

### Gemino Gems

Earn Gemino Gems with each level completed. These gems determine your global leaderboard position, with more gems leading to a higher rank. Stay motivated and keep improving your skills.

### Gemino Streak

Maintain a learning streak to develop consistency. Gemino tracks your daily logins and learning activities. If you complete at least one level per day, your streak continues. The streak is displayed on your dashboard and the global leaderboard.

### Gemino Tags

As you progress through the levels, you'll earn tags based on your performance. These tags are displayed on your dashboard and global profile, showcasing your achievements.

### Global Leaderboard

Compete with other users on the global leaderboard based on your Gemino Gems and performance. Compare your progress with fellow learners in a friendly manner.

## Integration

Gemino uses a magical AI integration to help you learn better. We appreciate OpenAI offerings and use their models to generate questions, verify answers, power the AI Chatbot (Bob), and generate AI flashcards.

We've used the GPT-3.5 model and concepts like OpenAI Functions and on-the-fly flashcard generation to make your learning experience interactive, fun, and exclusively unique.

With the help of Outerbase Commands, our AI integrations have custom-tailored data about your performance on the platform, providing you with custom and exclusive content on demand.

The Vercel AI package offers better integration of OpenAI offerings, providing a fast and smooth user experience.

## How Outerbase acts as the backbone of Gemino

Outerbase streamlines database operations, enhancing productivity and facilitating real-time team collaboration for accelerated task completion. It serves as the gateway to our database, ensuring smooth two-route transactions of data between the database and the user.
